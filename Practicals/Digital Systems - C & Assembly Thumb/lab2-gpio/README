A program for an electronic Valentine's card that displays a beating
heart image on the LEDs.  You are invited to make it interactive by
displaying a different pattern when one of the buttons is pressed.

PROGRAMS

heart.c -- initial beating heart program

heart-intr.c -- interrupt-driven static display


TASKS:
1. Compile and run the supplied program heart.c.
2. Make it interactive by displaying a different image if
   either of the two buttons is pressed.
3. Experiment with effects like fading, by limiting the time
   within each cycle when the LEDs are illuminated.  Or display a
   greyscale image by illuminating different LEDs for different times.
