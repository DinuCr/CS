DIGITAL SYSTEMS

This repository contains the lab materials for the course.  There are
multiple directories, each corresponding to a 'lab' that we will
use in one part of the course.  Many labs may contain copies of
the same file: for example, each contains a file 'hardware.h' that
contains addresses of the I/O device registers on the Nordic chip.  As
far as possible, these files are the same in each lab -- but if
enhancements are needed for later labs, I will avoid disruption
during the term by not uploading the modified versions into the
earlier labs.  Clear?


PROJECTS

lab0-echo

        A simple program -- written entirely in C -- that accepts
        lines of input from the serial console and print them back.
        Intended as a test that the toolchain is working.

lab1-asm

        A program with an subroutine written in assembly language.
        The main program (written in C) prompts for two unsigned
        integers x, y on the serial console, then calls a subroutine
        foo(x, y) and prints the result.  The supplied program defines
        foo(x, y) = x + y, but you are invited to redefine it in
        various ways.

lab2-gpio

        A program for an electronic Valentine's card that displays a
        beating heart image on the LEDs.  You are invited to make it
        interactive by displaying a different pattern when one of the
        buttons is pressed.

lab3-primes

        A program that prints a list of primes on the serial port.
        One version uses polling to find when the serial port is ready
        to transmit a character; another uses interrupts, and is able
        to overlap outputting one prime with the search for the next
        one.

lab4-phos

        A simple embedded operating system based on message-passing.


BITS AND PIECES

hack

        A buffer-overrun attack on the milk bill program.
