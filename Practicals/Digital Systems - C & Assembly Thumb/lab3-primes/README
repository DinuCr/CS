lab3-primes

A program that prints a list of primes on the serial port.  One
version uses polling to find when the serial port is ready to transmit
a character; another uses interrupts, and is able to overlap
outputting one prime with the search for the next one.

TASKS
1. Compare the two programs to see that one is faster than the other.
2. Try listing primes starting at 1000000 instead of 2, and see if that
   increases the difference in speed between the two programs.
3. Try reducing the size of the circular buffer.  How small can
   it be made before either (a) the running time incereases noticeably,
   or (b) the program stops working at all?
