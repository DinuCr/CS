lab0-echo

A simple program -- written entirely in C -- that accepts
lines of input from the serial console and print them back.
Intended as a test that the toolchain is working.

TASKS: Compile the program and run it on the microbit.

Say

    $ make

to compile the program, producing a file echo.hex ready for loading
into the micro:bit.  Then

    $ cp echo.hex /media/fred/MICROBIT

to load the program (replace 'fred' by your username).
